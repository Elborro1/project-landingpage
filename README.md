# project-landingpage
My first landing page.
I will be using HTML, CSS with FLexbox in this project.
I have based it on my love for H.P lovecraft books.

So far I have written out most of the HTML and CSS. I have found that creating my own work has proved alot more useful in my learning. I have googled many things so far. Using flexbox has definetly helped with the layout.
