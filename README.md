# project-landingpage
My first landing page.
I will be using HTML, CSS with FLexbox in this project.
I have based it on my love for H.P lovecraft books.

So far I have written out most of the HTML and CSS. I have found that creating my own work has proved alot more useful in my learning. I have googled many things so far. Using flexbox has definetly helped with the layout.  

I have been faced with a problem pushing my git to the repo. But through some googling and trial and error, I have seemed to rectify the problem. I think what happened was I made changes to my README on github, and it caused confusion with my local repo. But managed to sort it out by merging. Onced I had done that, I requested a pull, and then added the README.md file, commited and then pushed. And that seemed to work.

Today I have somewhat finished my landing page. I know there is much more to do, but I will update it as I learn more through the Odin Project.
